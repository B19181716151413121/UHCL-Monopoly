# UHCL-Monopoly
This is an attempted port of monopoly into python code. 
Currently has the player able to move around and purchase properties, the computer registers where the player is with a list.
On the player's turn, they can either choose to 'roll', show all properties owned with 'props', show player stats with 'stats'

The game is currently needing the ability to buy and sell houses and hotels, being able to sell and mortgage properties. Be able to move 
again with doubles, and implementation of the community chest and chance cards.
